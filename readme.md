## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID** to create a maintainable, scalable, and testable codebase.

*   **Language:** [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (100%)
*   **Architecture:** Clean Architecture (Domain, Data, Presentation layers), MVVM (in Presentation)
*   **Asynchronous Programming:**
    *   [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/overview.html) for managing background threads.
    *   [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) for reactive data streams.
    *   [Kotlin Channel](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/channels.html) for communication between coroutines (if applicable, specify use case).
*   **UI:**
    *   **XML Layouts:** Primarily used for most screens, leveraging the traditional Android View system.
    *   [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose): Used for the Settings screen, showcasing modern UI development.
    *   Material Design Components
*   **Backend:**
    *   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Provides backend services including:
        *   Authentication
        *   Realtime Database / Firestore (Specify which one you used)
        *   Cloud Storage (Likely for post images/media)
    *   [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions): For backend logic like triggering notifications.
*   **Background Processing:** [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) for guaranteed background task execution (post uploads).
*   **Dependency Injection:** (Mention if you used Hilt/Dagger/Koin - *Add this if applicable*)
*   **Testing:**
    *   JUnit4 / JUnit5
    *   Mockito / MockK
    *   **100% Unit Test Coverage** for `SettingsViewModel`.

## üöÄ Key Highlights

*   **Clean Architecture & SOLID:** Enforced for better separation of concerns and testability.
*   **Hybrid UI Approach:** Demonstrates proficiency in both traditional XML Views and modern Jetpack Compose.
*   **Robust Background Processing:** Utilizes WorkManager for reliable task execution.
*   **Real-time Features:** Leverages Firebase for live notifications and data synchronization.
*   **Well-Tested:** Includes significant unit test coverage, with key components like `SettingsViewModel` fully tested.
*   **Localization & Theming:** Built with accessibility and user preference in mind.
